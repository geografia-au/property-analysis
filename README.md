### What is this showing?
For effective Business Intelligence applications not only do we need to show effective visualization but also handle huge datasets. This project demonstrates fast visualization of more than half a million properties. Allowing users to query an area by custom radius and filter by the use-status of the properties.

For the residential properties we have the price and number of bedrooms, rooms, floors and bathrooms.

Geografia plans to enrich such tools with data from socio-economic modeling. This can be a powerful decision support tool for property analysts and developers needing more fine grained capacity to assess properties in a particular block, street, or even down to individual building level.

As the app is modular, we can add new features and data layers as required, to build up a rich information base. This can then be used to inform decisions on everything from property investment and optimum housing forms, to community infrastructure planning and demand forecasting
