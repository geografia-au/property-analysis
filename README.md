### What is this showing?
Business Intelligence applications not only need effective visualization but they also need to handle huge datasets. This project demonstrates fast visualization of more than **half a million properties**. Allowing users to query an area by custom radius and filter by the use-status of the properties.

For the residential properties we have the price and number of bedrooms, rooms, floors and bathrooms. This is a powerful decision support tool for property analysts and developers needing more fine grained capacity to assess properties in a particular block, street, or even down to individual building level.

As the app is modular, we can add new features and data layers as required, to build up a rich information base, including everything from population data to vacancy rates, vacant land flags, and any number of socio-economic indicators. As you add new layers, the tool's capability can be expanded to inform decisions on everything from property investment and optimum housing forms, to community infrastructure planning and service demand forecasting, even transport planning.
