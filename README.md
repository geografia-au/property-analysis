### What is this showing?
For effective Business Intelligence applications we need to not only show effecitve visualization but also handle huge datasets. This project demonstrates fast visualization of more than half a million properties. Allowing users to query an area by custom radius and filter by the use-status of the properties.

For the residential properties we have the price and number of bedrooms, rooms, floors and bathrooms.

Geografia plans to enrich such tools with data from socio-economic modelling. This can be a powerful decision support tool for estate agents wanting to have more fine grain control over assessing a properties in a perticular block, street or even down to individual buildings.
